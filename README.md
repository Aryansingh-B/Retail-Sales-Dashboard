## 🗄️ Database Schema

Designed a normalized relational schema in MySQL for a fictional retail business:

```
customers ──────┐
                ├──── orders ──── order_items ──── products ──── categories
returns ────────┘
```

| Table | Description | Records |
|---|---|---|
| `customers` | Customer profiles across 4 regions of India | 500 |
| `products` | Product catalog across 10 categories | 100 |
| `categories` | Product categories and departments | 10 |
| `orders` | Order headers (2022–2024) | 3,000 |
| `order_items` | Line-level order details | ~8,500 |
| `returns` | Returned items with reasons | ~180 |

> Also includes `vw_sales_fact` — a flat denormalized view joining all tables, used as the primary data source in Power BI.

## 🧮 DAX Measures

```dax
Total Revenue    = SUMX('retail_db vw_sales_fact', 'retail_db vw_sales_fact'[revenue])
Total Profit     = SUMX('retail_db vw_sales_fact', 'retail_db vw_sales_fact'[profit])
Total Orders     = DISTINCTCOUNT('retail_db vw_sales_fact'[order_id])
Profit Margin %  = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Revenue], 0)
Avg Order Value  = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Orders], 0)
Revenue LY       = CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
YoY Growth %     = DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - [Revenue LY], [Revenue LY], 0)
Return Rate %    = DIVIDE(COUNTROWS('retail_db returns'), [Total Orders], 0)
Total Customers  = DISTINCTCOUNT('retail_db vw_sales_fact'[customer_id])
Total Returns    = COUNTROWS('retail_db returns')
```

## 💡 Business Insights Discovered

- **Furniture and Electronics alone drove 62.5% of total revenue** despite being just 2 of 10 categories — suggesting inventory investment should be concentrated here
- **Revenue was flat in 2023 (+0.23%)** but surged **+20.10% in 2024**, indicating strong business growth
- **South region consistently leads** in both revenue and order volume
- **Q4 is peak season** — October to December shows the highest monthly revenue across all years
- **UPI is the dominant payment method** — optimizing UPI checkout experience could reduce cart abandonment
- Products with **no discount** generate higher profit margins than heavily discounted items
